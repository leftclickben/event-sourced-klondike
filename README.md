# Event Sourced Patience

Demonstration of event sourcing using Patience as the problem domain.

This monorepo consists of two applications:

* The `backend` directory contains an AWS Serverless implementation of the game engine and API: [README](./backend/README.md)
* The `frontend-cli` directory contains a simple NodeJS based command line application to play the game: [README](./frontend-cli/README.md)

See the individual README files for more details.

The primary system requirement is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).
